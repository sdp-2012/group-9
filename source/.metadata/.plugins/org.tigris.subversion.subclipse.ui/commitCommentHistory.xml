	<CommitComment>Data commit, entity_props.xml is not used anymore, Vision loads &amp; saves either entity_props_pitch1.xml or entity_props_pitch2.xml.</CommitComment>

	<CommitComment>* Completely redesigned the Strategy module, now works with actions &amp; conditions. Easier to write complex strategies, no need to re-plan all the time. Right now, KickBallAction is a bit of a do-everything action, I need to refactor that a little bit.
* Changed our game-playing strategy to a simple yet continuous (in the mathematical sense) function, that worked _very_ well during the Sunday tournament.
* Obstacle avoidance was moved to Control, but it&apos;s not working yet. I&apos;m planning on changing our obstacle avoidance to a simpler, more predictable method.
* Fixed not stopping at goal in Control - should work much more predictably now.
* Implemented flags for Control to specify reversing, matching rotation, avoid walls etc.
* Made Control use the pitch size from World.
* Made it easier to change between pitches - still not ideal, but there&apos;s two changes needed, at the top of Vision.java and PcServer.java.
* Milestone strategies don&apos;t work anymore, if anyone has the patience they can port them to the new Strategy framework, right now other stuff is high priority.
* The click-to-go behaviour was given a face-lift. By click-dragging aiming can be specified as well. Shift-clicking adds a waypoint, so one can specify a path. This behaviour is now part of the NormalMatchStrategy (we may want to create a DebugStrategy instead), thus cleaning up the listeners in NxtGui and SimGui.</CommitComment>
