/** Abstract class that keeps track of the state of the world. This includes the state of the two robots and the ball, as well
 * as the sensor values of the player's robot. It also stores the desired wheel speeds (that are set by Control), which get
 * sent to the robot every time step.
 * The class is abstract because it doesn't provide the implementation for the world update (method update()). There are two
 * classes which inherit this one: SimWorld and NxtWorld:
 * - In the case of the SimWorld, the update simulates one time step using the wheel speeds provided and (possibly) generates
 *   an image that is then passed to Vision to estimate the new positions and orientations of the robots.
 * - The NxtWorld corresponds to the real, physical world. The desired wheel speeds are communicated to the robot, using the
 *   Communication class. The latter is also used to fetch an image from the camera which is processed by a Vision object to
 *   estimate the new positions and orientations which will be available to the Strategy in the next time step.
